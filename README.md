# Pug Chat App 
Pug is a template engine, allowing variables to be passed from the server into pug, which then creates and renders the new HTML file for the client. 

## Software Dependencies 
* Node.js
* NPM 

## Frameworks 
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Pug 

## Configuration 
* MongdoDB <br> 
You will need to connect an instance of MongoDB to this app. One approach is using Atlas (https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) <br> 
Then use the link in your ```.env``` file. 

## Installation and Running
Inside of the root directory, install packages with ```npm i``` <br> 
Then run ```node server.js``` or use ```nodemon server.js``` instead to re-run the server on saves and edits.
